            <p>Sloths have very low metabolic rates (less than half of that expected for a mammal of their size) and low body temperatures when active 30 to 34°C. Sloths are heterothermic, meaning their body temperature may vary according to the environment, normally ranging from 25 to 35°C, but able to drop to as low as 20°C.</p>
